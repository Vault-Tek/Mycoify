## 1. üçÑ Mushroom Stock Tab: Improved Harvest Entry

- **Grams Enforcement:**  
  - Changed the harvest input to require values in the format `NNg` or `NN.Ng` (e.g. `22g`, `15.5g`).
  - If a user enters a value not ending in `g`, the app now displays an error notification.
- **Harvest Log:**  
  - Added a list of the 10 most recent harvests to the Mushroom Stock tab, showing grams, source tub (if available), species, and date.
- **Offload Enforcement:**  
  - The Offload Product form now also requires product quantities in the format `NNg` or `NN.Ng` (e.g. `10g`).
  - Prevents offloading more product than is currently in stock.

## 2. üóÇÔ∏è Side Menu & Navigation: Usability and Layout

- **Stable Release Label:**  
  - Added a ‚Äúv0.2.00 Stable Release‚Äù label at the bottom of the side menu.
  - Used `display: flex; flex-direction: column;` for the `.side-menu` container and `margin-top: auto;` for `.side-menu-version` to ensure it is always at the very bottom.
- **Responsive Menu:**  
  - The side menu now slides in/out smoothly.
  - Menu closes automatically when:
    - A user clicks outside the menu (on the overlay/background).
    - A user clicks any menu option (including Export/Save, Import/Load).
  - Overlay (`.side-menu-bg`) is handled via JS and CSS to match menu state.
- **Hamburger Button:**  
  - Hamburger icon is always visible when the menu is closed, and hides when menu is open.
  - Menu is accessible on all screen sizes (mobile and desktop).

## 3. üßæ Dashboard & Data Display

- **Dashboard Cards:**  
  - Displays Supplies in Inventory, Mushroom Stock (g) and Value, Total Expenses, and Total Profit at the top of the app.
- **Tabs:**  
  - Added and improved Inventory, Runs, Colonizing, Fruiting, Mushroom Stock, and Offload Product tabs.
  - All tab switching is now handled cleanly:
    - The selected tab highlights.
    - Switching tabs closes the side menu for a seamless UX.

## 4. üì¶ Data Import/Export

- **Export:**  
  - Export now saves a detailed text file with all supplies, runs, colonizing/fruiting tubs, flushes, harvests, offloads, and more.
- **Import:**  
  - Import reads this format and restores all application state.

---

## 5. üö¶ Validation, Notifications, and Feedback

- **User Feedback:**  
  - Added clear notifications for invalid entries (e.g., wrong format for grams, offloading more than available, etc).
  - Success and error notifications are visually distinct.
- **Validation:**  
  - All numeric fields are validated for format and bounds.
  - Unit cost for `ml` supplies now expects a total price for all ml, and calculates per-ml cost.

---

## 6. üß™ Fruiting/Colonizing Upgrades

- **Flush Modal:**  
  - Added a modal for logging flushes for fruting tubs, including flush history and the ability to "dump" a tub.
- **Fruiting:**  
  - Move colonized tubs to fruiting with a date and species autofill.
- **Colonizing:**  
  - Track species, tub ID, inoc date, and planned outtake date.

---

## 7. üíæ Local Persistence

- **Local Storage:**  
  - All data (supplies, runs, mushrooms, offloads, tubs, flushes, etc) is saved and loaded from browser local storage.

---

## 8. üè∑Ô∏è Miscellaneous UI/UX

- **Styling:**  
  - Consistent dark theme with Tailwind and custom CSS.
  - Modern, rounded cards and input fields.
- **Accessibility:**  
  - Button labels and ARIA attributes for navigation and modals.

## 9. üõ†Ô∏è Bug Fixes

- **Menu Overlay:**  
  - Fixed overlay click not closing the menu, by correcting event listeners to detect background clicks only.
- **Tab Switch Handling:**  
  - Switching tabs via menu always closes the side menu.
- **Harvest/Offload Edge Cases:**  
  - Prevented negative or invalid stock/offload entries.
  - Ensured notifications appear for all invalid actions.
