# Mycoify v0.0.07 – Patch Notes

## ✨ New Features & Improvements

### ⚗️ "ml" Unit Bulk Pricing Support
- **Special handling for "ml" (milliliter) unit supplies:**
  - When adding a supply with unit "ml", the **unit cost** is now calculated automatically from the total price entered divided by the quantity, so you can simply enter the total price you paid for all ml.
  - The system will store and display the cost per ml (to 4 decimal places) and always show an accurate total cost.
- **ML Usage Hint:**  
  - When "ml" is entered in the unit field, a yellow hint appears:  
    > "For ml: Enter the total price for all ml, not per ml!"
  - This helps prevent confusion and ensures correct bulk entry for liquid supplies.

### 🧑‍🔬 Inventory Add/Update
- Inventory form now requires a positive quantity (no zero or negatives).
- ml handling logic only applies to supplies where unit is exactly "ml" (case-insensitive).

### 🪄 UI/UX Enhancements
- The "ml" hint is context-aware and only appears when relevant.
- Table now displays cost per unit to four decimal places for precise tracking of small units (e.g., $0.0034/ml).
- All supply and run input validation maintained.

### 📦 All Previous Features Retained
- Interactive production run supply table, additive inventory, readable TXT import/export, offload/product tracking, and dashboard summaries remain unchanged.

## 🛠️ Everything Else (from v0.0.06)
- Supplies merge by name/unit, quantities add, cost/unit updates
- Production runs: direct, table-driven usage input
- Mushroom harvest, offload/sell, profit, and valuation
- Human-readable TXT export/import
- Local storage, responsive UI, notifications

## 📝 Known Limitations (Unchanged)
- Deleting a run or supply does not restore inventory/stock
- No cloud/multi-user features
- TXT import expects correct format—edit with care!

**Upgrade Note:**  
When adding liquid supplies (ml), always enter the *total* price you paid for the quantity. The app will calculate per-ml automatically and display this for accuracy!
