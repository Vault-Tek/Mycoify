# Mycoify v0.0.03 – Patch Notes

## 🆕 New Features & Improvements

### Inventory Supplies – Units Support!
- **Unit field added for each supply item** (e.g., "bag", "ml", "lb", etc.).
  - Input form now includes a "Unit" field.
  - Supplies table displays the unit for each supply item.
  - Unit is required for all supplies—prevents saving supplies without specifying a unit.
  - When updating a supply, the unit is also updated.

### Smarter Production Run Logging
- **Supply usage prompt now shows units** for each supply (e.g., "Peat moss (bag), Water (ml)").
- **Production Run table** now displays units next to supply amounts used (e.g., "Peat moss: 2 bag, Water: 500 ml").
- All supply usage, deduction, and display logic now tracks units for clarity.

### Polished Input Validation
- Prevents adding supply entries without a unit, or with invalid values.
- All forms now require units for supply items.

## 📝 Display & Usability Tweaks

- Supplies table: now includes a “Unit” column for quick reference.
- Production Runs: supply usage column includes both quantity and unit for each item.
- No changes to existing mushroom harvest, offload, export/import, or dashboard logic.

## 🛠️ Everything Else (Retained from 0.0.02)
- Inventory add/update/delete with per-unit cost and total cost calculations.
- Production run logging (mushroom production still optional per run).
- Mushroom stock/harvest management and stock valuation.
- Offload/sell feature with profit calculation.
- Local storage persistence, import/export, dark-themed responsive UI, and notifications.

## 📝 Known Limitations (Unchanged)
- Deleting a run does not restore supply counts.
- No cloud sync or multi-user support.
- Basic profit/expense analytics only.

**Upgrade Note:**  
Supplies from previous versions will not have a "unit" field—please edit existing supplies and add their correct units for proper display and calculations.
