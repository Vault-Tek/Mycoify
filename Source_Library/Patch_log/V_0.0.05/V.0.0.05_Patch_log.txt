# Mycoify v0.0.05 ‚Äì Patch Notes

## ‚ú® Major New Feature: Interactive Supply Usage Table for Production Runs

### Production Runs ‚Äì Modernized Supply Selection!
- **GUI table for supply usage:**  
  - When adding a new production run, users now see a table listing all supplies in stock, their available quantity, unit, and an input field to specify how much to use for that run.
  - No more usage prompts or manual comma-separated entry‚Äîjust enter the amount for each supply directly and visually!

- **Validations & User Guidance:**
  - Input for each supply cannot exceed what is in stock.
  - Negative numbers are prevented.
  - If any supply usage exceeds available stock, a clear error is shown and the run is not added.

- **Automatic Table Updates:**
  - The supply usage table in the run form updates live when supplies are added, updated, or deleted.
  - This ensures users always interact with accurate inventory values.

### Improved User Experience Across Inventory and Runs
- Whenever you add, update, or delete supplies, the run supply table refreshes automatically.
- After importing data, the table also refreshes for consistency.

### Under-the-Hood & UI Adjustments
- Cleaner, more robust code:  
  - Run supply usage is now an array based on the visual table inputs.
  - Table and form rendering is modular for easy maintenance.
- Visual tweaks:  
  - Supply usage inputs have a distinct background and style for clarity.

## üõ†Ô∏è Everything Else (Retained from 0.0.04)
- Inventory add/update/delete (merges by name/unit, adds quantity, updates cost/unit)
- Production run logging (with per-supply usage, units, and cost deduction)
- Mushroom stock management, harvest logging, and valuation
- Offload/sell with profit calculation
- Local storage, import/export, responsive UI, notifications

## üìù Known Limitations (Unchanged)
- Deleting a run or supply does not restore inventory or stock
- No multi-user/cloud features
- Basic analytics only
