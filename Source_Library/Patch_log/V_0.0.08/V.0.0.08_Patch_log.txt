# Mycoify v0.0.08 – Patch Notes

## ✨ Improvements & Fixes

### 🧪 Inventory: Case-Insensitive Matching for Supplies
- **Inventory now uses case-insensitive matching for both supply name and unit when adding/updating supplies.**
  - Prevents accidental duplicate entries due to differences in capitalization (e.g., "Peat moss" vs "peat moss", "ML" vs "ml").
  - When updating an existing supply, the original name/unit casing is preserved, but matches are found regardless of case.

### 🧑‍🔬 Production Run Import Robustness
- **Importing runs from TXT lab logs now matches supplies by name in a case-insensitive way.**
  - Fixes issues where imported production runs would not properly associate used supplies if there were case mismatches.
  - Ensures all runs correctly reflect supply usage, even if names/units differ in case.

### 👁️‍🗨️ UX/UI
- All previous features, hints, and validations remain in place.
- No changes to dashboard layout, run entry, or export format.

### 🛠️ Technical Details
- Added helper function for supply matching that ignores case.
- All inventory operations (add/update/merge) now use this robust case-insensitive logic.
- TXT import logic for runs also compares supply names in a case-insensitive manner.

## 🛠️ Everything Else (Retained from v0.0.07)
- Bulk pricing for "ml" supplies, with hint for total price entry.
- Human-readable TXT export/import.
- Interactive supply/run tables, harvest/offload management, and dashboard summaries.
- Local storage, notifications, responsive UI.

## 📝 Known Limitations (Unchanged)
- Deleting a run or supply does not restore inventory/stock.
- No cloud/multi-user features.
- TXT import expects correct format—edit with care!

**Upgrade Note:**  
This update is especially important if you work with supplies that may be entered with different capitalization over time—your logs and run histories will now always import and merge correctly!
