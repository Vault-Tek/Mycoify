# Mycoify Patch Notes – 2025-07-18

## Changes and Additions

### 1. Hamburger Menu Behavior Improved
- **Feature:** The hamburger menu button is now hidden whenever the side menu is open, and reappears when the menu is closed.
- **Benefit:** Prevents double menu open/close situations and provides a cleaner interface.

### 2. Full Import/Export Functionality
- **Feature:** Export saves the entire lab session (supplies, runs, colonizing, fruiting, mushrooms, offloads, flushes, etc.) to a plain text file.
- **Feature:** Import now fully restores all lab data from a previously exported file, matching the exported format exactly.
- **Benefit:** You can export your session, close the app, and later import the file to continue your lab work seamlessly.

### 3. UI and Data Model Integrity
- **Assurance:** No features or tabs were removed or broken during the update.
- **Assurance:** All tabs—Inventory, Production Runs, Colonizing, Fruiting, Mushroom Stock, and Offloads—remain fully functional.
- **Assurance:** All CRUD logic (add, update, delete) remains unchanged except for explicit improvements above.

### 4. Data Tracking and Logging
- **Feature:** Offloads (sales) are logged with quantity, price, and date, and preserved across export/import.
- **Feature:** Expenses, income, flush history, and mushroom stock are recalculated and restored correctly on import.

### 5. Patch Packaging
- **Delivery:** The final code is provided as a single HTML file. No placeholder comments for missing code—everything required to run the app is present in the file.
- **Instruction:** You can copy-paste the entire file into a blank `.html` file and use it immediately.
