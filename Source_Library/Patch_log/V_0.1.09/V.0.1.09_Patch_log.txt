  * Rebuilt all primary components and containers for better alignment, consistency, and readability.
  * Updated card structures, tab styling, and section headers to follow a more elegant and legible format.
  * This redesign significantly improves usability across devices while preparing the interface for future mobile integration.

### 🔘 Button System Revamp

* **Standardized and restyled all buttons throughout the interface:**

## 📊 Features & Functionality

### 💰 New: Cost Per Sale Tracking

* **Added dynamic "Cost Per Sale" calculation support:**

  * Users can now assign cost data to each offload or batch, giving them insight into profitability per sale or harvest.
  * This includes tracking substrate, material, and labor cost inputs (where available) for each production run.
  * Results are presented directly in the offload tracking section, supporting better financial decision-making and lab planning.

## 🗃️ Storage & Architecture Improvements

### 📦 Migration to `userLocal` Storage Schema

* **Overhauled data storage model:**

  * Transitioned away from generic local device storage to a structured `userLocal` format for more granular control over user-specific data.
  * Prepares the application for authenticated multi-user profiles and data syncing in the future.
  * Also helps isolate and persist session data across tabs or devices (where supported) with fewer collisions or state resets.

### 📱 Foundations for Mobile Functionality

* **Began groundwork for mobile support:**

  * Refactored layout containers and component responsiveness to adapt fluidly on small and medium screens.
  * Introduced dynamic viewport breakpoints and scalable element sizing to ensure consistent usability on tablets and smartphones.
  * Although full mobile support is still in progress, this patch introduces the foundational logic necessary to bring Mycoify to a mobile-first workflow.

## 🛠️ Fixes & Stability Enhancements

### 🧭 Side Menu Behavior Fixed

* **Resolved persistent issues with side menu functionality:**

  * Fixed erratic collapsing/expanding states on different screen sizes.
  * Resolved overlap and click-layer bugs that caused some UI elements to appear behind or inside the menu on interaction.
  * Improved responsiveness and animation timing for a smoother and more intuitive sidebar experience.

### 🗃️ Import/Export Bug Resolved

* **Fixed export/import failure for select users:**

  * Addressed a critical bug where the import/export functions silently failed under certain browser conditions (especially when storage was in a malformed state).
  * Rebuilt internal handlers to ensure consistent formatting, proper encoding, and fail-safe operations during data export and import events.
  * Now supports wider compatibility across Chromium-based and mobile browsers.
