# Mycoify Patch Notes – 2025-07-18

## Summary of Today's Modifications

### 1. Hamburger Menu & Navigation
- **Improved Hamburger Menu:**  
  The hamburger ("☰") button now hides when the menu is open and shows again when closed, preventing duplicate toggles and providing a cleaner experience.
  Previously we experienced a bug where the hamburger menu would persist, and block import/export data on the side when attempting to access the menu.

### 2. Import/Export: Reliable Session Continuity
- **Export:**  
  All lab session data (supplies, runs, colonizing, fruiting, mushrooms, offloads, flushes, etc.) is exported to a `.txt` file in a human-readable format.
- **Import:**  
  The import feature is now fully implemented. Uploading a previously exported file restores the entire lab state, including recalculating expenses, profit, income, and mushroom stock. No placeholder code remains.
  We has this implemented before, but our development team ran into some issues regarding 

### 3. Offload Sale Tracking Improvements
- **Cost Per Sale:**  
  Offload (product sale) logs now include both sale quantity and total price, and these are shown in the offloads tab and persisted across export/import.
- **Profit/Income Calculations:**  
  Profit and income statistics on the dashboard now update automatically as sales are logged or imported.

### 4. UI/UX Enhancements
- **Button Styles:**  
  Buttons have been redesigned for improved visibility and usability, with clearer visual feedback and modern color schemes.
- **Layout Polish:**  
  The dashboard and tab layouts were cleaned up for clarity and mobile friendliness.
- **Tab Navigation:**  
  Navigation between Inventory, Runs, Colonizing, Fruiting, Mushrooms, and Offloads is now more visually distinct.
- **Input Hints:**  
  Added a hint for "ml" unit entries to avoid confusion about price per unit.

### 5. Data Model & Table Enhancements
- **Flush History:**  
  Flushes for each tub are now shown in a modal dialog, making it easier to log harvests and dumps.
- **Harvested Tubs List:**  
  Tubs that are dumped are tracked and included in export/import.
- **All CRUD Logic:**  
  Create, update, and delete actions for all entities (supplies, runs, tubs, sales) remain reliable and are fully restored on import.

### 6. Whole File Delivery
- The final product is delivered as a single, ready-to-use HTML file—no code is omitted or referenced externally.
- You can copy, paste, and rename the file as `mycoify.html` and it will work out of the box.
