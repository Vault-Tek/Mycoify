# Mycoify v0.0.02 ‚Äì Patch Notes

## ‚ú® What‚Äôs New & Changed

### Production Runs: Mushrooms Produced Now Optional!
- The ‚ÄúMushrooms Produced (g)‚Äù field in Production Runs is now **optional**.  
  - You can leave it blank, set it to zero, or enter a positive value.
  - If left blank or set to zero, the run will still be recorded, but will not increase the mushroom stock.
  - This is reflected in both the input form and the production runs table (displays "‚Äî" if not set).

### Improved Production Run Validation
- You can now create a run with zero mushrooms produced, as long as you enter a run name and valid supply usage.
- The run entry form and validation logic now permit blank or zero mushroom values.

### Production Run Table Display
- The table in the ‚ÄúProduction Runs‚Äù tab now shows "‚Äî" for runs where no mushrooms were produced (previously showed 0).
- Ensures clearer distinction between no harvest and zero harvest.

### Internal Code/Logic Adjustments
- The `addRun` function now:
  - Accepts, parses, and stores blank/zero mushroom entries.
  - Only increments mushroom stock if the value is greater than zero.
  - Maintains all other behavior (supply deduction, total cost, expense tracking).

## üõ†Ô∏è Everything Else (Retained from 0.0.01)
- Full inventory management (add/update/delete supplies, total cost tracking)
- Production run logging with per-supply usage and cost deduction
- Mushroom stock management, with harvests and stock valuation
- Product offloading/selling, profit and income calculation
- Local storage persistence, import/export tools
- Responsive, dark-themed UI with notifications and real-time updates

## üìù Known Limitations (Unchanged)
- Deleting a production run does not restore supply counts.
- Data is still stored locally only‚Äîno cloud sync or multi-user support.
- No advanced analytics or charting.

**Upgrade Note:**  
If you previously had runs with 0 mushrooms, those will now be displayed as "‚Äî" in the Production Runs table for clarity.
