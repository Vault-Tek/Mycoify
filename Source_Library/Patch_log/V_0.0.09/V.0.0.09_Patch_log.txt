# Mycoify v0.0.09 – Patch Notes

## ✨ Improvements & Fixes

### 🔢 Improved Supply Unit Cost Input (Decimal/Comma Support)
- **Supply cost input now accepts both periods and commas as decimal separators** (e.g., `12,5` or `12.5` both work).  
  - This makes the app friendlier for international users and anyone who prefers a comma as a decimal separator.
  - The input is now text-based (`inputmode="decimal"`, pattern for decimals) for better mobile compatibility and to eliminate accidental up/down arrows.

### 🧪 Inventory Add/Update
- When entering supply unit cost, any commas are automatically converted to periods, ensuring correct numeric parsing.
- All other validations remain in place: quantity must be positive, cost non-negative, and unit required.

### 🧑‍🔬 No Change to Export/Import, UI, or Data Model
- TXT export and import, production run logic, offload, and dashboard all continue to work as before.
- All case-insensitivity and "ml" (bulk price) logic is retained.
- "ml" hint, UI, and all prior logic unchanged except for accepting comma/period for prices.

### 🛠️ Technical Details
- The supply input cost string is parsed with `replace(",", ".")` before conversion to number.
- This ensures robust and predictable handling for users regardless of locale.

## 🛠️ Everything Else (Retained from v0.0.08)
- Case-insensitive supply matching and import.
- Bulk pricing for "ml" unit, hint, and division logic.
- Human-readable TXT export/import, interactive supply/run tables, harvest/offload, dashboard, notifications.

## 📝 Known Limitations (Unchanged)
- Deleting a run or supply does not restore inventory/stock.
- No cloud/multi-user features.
- TXT import expects correct format—edit with care!

**Upgrade Note:**  
You can now use commas or periods for supply prices (e.g., `25,00` = `25.00`). For best results, always check your data after import/export!
