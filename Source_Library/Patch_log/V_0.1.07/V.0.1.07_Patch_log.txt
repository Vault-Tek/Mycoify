  - Modal actions such as logging flushes/dumping tubs now use the same button styles as the main UI.

  Removed unnecessary button reactivity/hover effects from destructive actions, keeping them clear and straightforward.

  Ensured all form buttons and destructive actions have clear color contrast and descriptive labels.
