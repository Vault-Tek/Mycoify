# Mycoify v0.1.07 – Patch Notes

## ✨ Improvements to Fruiting Tracking

### 🍄 Fruiting Tab & Flush Logging Overhaul
- **Fruiting "Flush #" Display** simplified:
  - Now always shows the current flush number (e.g. "1st", "2nd", "3rd", etc.) based on the last flush logged—no more confusing "last" flush text.
  - After moving a tub to fruiting, the flush count starts at "1st" only after a flush is logged.
  - The flush number is now directly tied to the most recent flush entry for clarity, instead of inferring from a zero-gram starter.
- **Flush Log Modal Updates:**
  - The flush log modal now requires an explicit flush number (numeric input, minimum 1).
  - The flush "start date" is now clearly labeled and required.
  - The close "X" button on the flush modal is always wired up, ensuring no accidental orphan modals.

### 🖥️ UI/UX Enhancements
- **Cleaner Fruiting Table:** Only the current flush number is shown for each tub, making the interface less cluttered and more intuitive.
- **Modal Consistency:** Consistent close behavior for modals, including the "X" button.
- **Date Inputs:** Improved date labeling and validation for flush logs.

## 📝 Data & Compatibility
- **Fruiting Tubs:** When moving a tub to fruiting, its flush log is now started empty. The first flush is only counted once you log it.
- **No Dummy Flushes:** Removed the creation of zero-gram "starter" flushes for new fruiting tubs—historical data remains compatible.

## 🛠️ Bug Fixes & Minor Tweaks
- Fixed a bug where flush numbers could get out of sync with actual logs.
- Better validation for flush number, date, and grams in the modal.
- Improved notification and modal handling under rare error conditions.

## 📝 Known Limitations
- Flush numbers must be entered manually; the app does not auto-increment or auto-suggest the next flush number.
- No "edit" or "remove" for existing flush logs yet.
- Import/export compatible, but old TXT logs with dummy flushes will simply show as extra historical flushes.
