- By default, the summary/info panel is **closed** when you switch tabs or import data.
- Click the summary title bar (with the arrow) to **expand** or **collapse** the panel:
  - ‚ñ∂ (arrow right) = collapsed/hidden
  - ‚ñº (arrow down) = expanded/visible
- The panel always starts closed when switching tabs, but **remembers your open/close action** within the current tab.

### üñ•Ô∏è UI/UX Enhancements
- The summary title row is now a button with a clickable arrow for clear interaction.
- The summary panel expands/collapses smoothly and immediately updates on tab switch or data change.

### üîÑ Improved Reactivity
- The summary panel auto-updates and closes when switching tabs, importing logs, or making data changes.
- Opening the summary panel stays open as long as you remain on the same tab.
