# Mycoify v0.0.06 ‚Äì Patch Notes

## ‚ú® New Features & Changes

### Human-Readable Export & Import (TXT Lab Log)
- **Export your entire lab as a readable `.txt` file**:
  - New button: **Export / Save**
  - Exports all supplies, runs, offloads, and summary (mushroom count, market price, expenses, income) in a plain text, human-parsable format.
  - Fields are pipe (`|`) separated for easy viewing or editing.
- **Import lab data from a `.txt` file**:
  - New button: **Import / Load**
  - Supports reloading the lab state from a backup or moving data between devices.
  - Will reset all current data when a file is loaded.
  - Accepts only the format produced by the export.

### TXT Log Format Overview
- **Supplies:** `name | qty | unit | unitCost`
- **Runs:** `name | ISO date | used supplies | mushroomsMade | totalCost`
- **Offloads:** `qty | date | income`
- **Summary:** mushrooms, market price, expenses, income
