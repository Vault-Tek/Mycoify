# Mycoify v0.1.05 ‚Äì Patch Notes

## ‚ú® New Feature: Summary/Info Panel for Every Tab!

### üßæ Contextual Tab Summary Panel
- A new **summary panel** appears at the bottom of every main tab (Inventory, Runs, Colonizing, Fruiting, Mushrooms, Offloads).
- **Shows key information relevant to the current tab**:
  - **Inventory:** Lists all supplies, quantity, and unit cost.
  - **Production Runs:** Lists recent runs with output and cost.
  - **Colonizing:** Lists all colonizing tubs, species, inoculation, and outtake dates.
  - **Fruiting:** Lists all fruiting tubs with species and start dates.
  - **Mushrooms:** Shows current mushroom stock and value.
  - **Offloads:** Shows recent offloads/sales.
- **Auto-updates** whenever you switch tabs or change data.

### üñ•Ô∏è UI/UX Enhancements
- Summary panel styled with matching dark theme; easy to read and automatically hidden when not needed.
- All summary panels use simple but information-rich bullet lists for quick reference.
- Existing modal, menu, and tab logic are retained.

### üõ†Ô∏è Everything Else (Retained from v0.0.04+)
- Full tub flush/dump log in Fruiting (modal)
- Soft delete for all major entities, with full history in export/import
- Mobile-friendly, responsive design
- TXT import/export with flush logs, harvest logs, and soft delete status
- All decimal/comma input flexibility, local storage, notifications, etc.

## üìù Known Limitations
- No "undelete" feature yet (restoration is by re-adding or import edit)
- No cloud sync/multi-user
- TXT import expects correct format
