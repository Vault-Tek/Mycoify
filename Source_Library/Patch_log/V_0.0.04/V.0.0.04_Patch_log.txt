# Mycoify v0.0.04 ‚Äì Patch Notes

## üÜï New Features & Improvements

### Inventory Management: Smarter Supply Updates
- **"Quantity to Add" for Supplies:**  
  - When adding a supply that already exists (same name and unit), the entered quantity is now **added** to the existing stock (previously, it replaced the quantity).
  - Form hint clarifies this behavior:  
    > "If supply exists, quantity will be increased. Units and cost will be updated."
  - Units and cost per unit are always updated to the latest entered value.

### Inventory Form & Table
- Inventory input form changes:
  - "Quantity" field label changed to "Quantity to Add" for clarity.
  - Helper text added beneath the form for user guidance.
- Supplies table, supply merging, and update logic all now respect this additive behavior.

### Under-the-Hood Logic Updates
- The "addSupply" function now:
  - Finds supplies by both **name and unit** (case-insensitive).
  - Increases quantity when a match is found, rather than replacing it.
  - Updates unit and cost to the latest input, even when merging.
- Cleaner, more robust supply management for recurring or bulk additions.

### UI/UX Polish
- Mushroom tab market price row made more visually prominent and aligned for clarity.
- All other features and table displays remain consistent.

## üõ†Ô∏è Everything Else (Retained from 0.0.03)
- Add/update/delete inventory items with per-unit cost
- Run logging with per-supply usage (with units), cost deduction, and optional mushroom production
- Mushroom stock and valuation
- Offload/sell with profit calculation
- Local storage, import/export, responsive UI, real-time notifications

## üìù Known Limitations (Unchanged)
- Deleting a supply or production run does not restore stock or inventory
- No multi-user/cloud features
- Only basic profit/expense analytics
