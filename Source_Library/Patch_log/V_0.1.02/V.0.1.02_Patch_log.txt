# Mycoify v0.1.02 – Patch Notes

## 🎉 Major Feature: Tub & Harvest Batch Tracking!

### 🍄 New: Colonizing & Fruiting Management Tabs
- **Colonizing Tubs Tab**
  - Log each new tub with:
    - **Species** (e.g., "Golden Teacher")
    - **Auto-incrementing Tub ID** (e.g., A1, A2, ..., B1, etc.)
    - **Inoculation Date** (auto-filled with today)
    - **Outtake Date** (date field; marks planned transfer to fruiting)
  - View, track, and delete colonizing tubs in a dedicated table.

- **Fruiting / Harvest Log Tab**
  - Move tubs from Colonizing to Fruiting by logging a harvest:
    - Select from available colonized tub IDs (only those not yet harvested)
    - Species auto-fills from colonizing log
    - Enter harvest date
    - View, track, and delete fruiting/harvest records in a dedicated table

- **Automatic Tub ID Generator**
  - Tub IDs auto-increment in a simple series for clear batch tracking.

### 🧭 New Navigation/UI: Slideout Side Menu!
- **Hamburger menu** at top left for quick access to:
  - Export / Save
  - Import / Load
- Menu overlays the app and closes on click outside or "Escape" key.

### 🧑‍🔬 UX & Workflow Improvements
- Colonizing and fruiting tabs are now top-level buttons, just like Inventory and Runs.
- All forms and tables are mobile-friendly and responsive.
- Tub selection and species autofill in Fruiting harvest entry streamlines batch logging.

### 📦 TXT Export/Import Extended
- **TXT export now includes Colonizing and Fruiting sections** for full batch log backup/restore.
- Import will restore all tubs, runs, supplies, offloads, and summary data in one go.

### 🛠️ Everything Else (Retained from v0.1.x)
- Decimal/comma input flexibility, ml-bulk handling, case-insensitive supply matching.
- All dashboard, run, offload, harvest, and inventory features remain unchanged.

## 📝 Known Limitations (Unchanged)
- No cross-linking of harvest batch with mushroom stock (stock not auto-incremented from fruiting tab).
- Deleting a tub or harvest does not affect inventory or mushroom count.
- TXT import expects correct format.
- No cloud/multi-user features.

**Upgrade Note:**  
You can now track every grow tub and harvest batch from inoculation to fruiting to offload—all in one place. Export/import for full lab backups now includes all tub/batch data!
