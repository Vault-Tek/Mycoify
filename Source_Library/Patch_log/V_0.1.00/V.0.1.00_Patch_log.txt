# Mycoify v0.1.00 – Patch Notes

## 🚀 0.1.00 Major Update

### 🔢 Universal Numeric Input: Decimal & Comma Support Everywhere!
- **All numeric fields (including supply cost, quantity, mushrooms produced, harvest, offload, market price, production run supply usage) now support both dot (`.`) and comma (`,`) as decimal separators.**
  - Works in all browsers and on all devices, including mobile.
  - You can type `3,14` or `3.14` and both will be interpreted as `3.14`.
- All numeric input fields now use `inputmode="decimal"` and an appropriate pattern for easier input and no accidental up/down arrows.
- Robust conversion ensures consistent decimal handling for all calculations and storage.

### 🧪 Inventory: More Intuitive & Flexible
- Supply quantity and unit cost fields now allow decimal/comma input, parsed and stored accurately.
- Case-insensitive, duplicate-avoiding supply matching is maintained.
- "ml" unit logic (bulk pricing) continues to work as before, now with improved decimal entry.

### 🧑‍🔬 Production Runs & Harvest
- All production run and harvest inputs now accept decimals using dot or comma.
- Table-driven supply usage for runs is more robust and mobile-friendly.

### 💸 Offloading & Market Price
- Offload/sell and market price inputs also accept both commas and dots as decimal separators.

### 📦 Import/Export (TXT)
- Exported TXT log remains unchanged, but underlying values are always correctly parsed and stored regardless of decimal separator used during entry.

### 🛠️ Technical Details
- All relevant inputs are normalized with `.replace(",", ".")` for numeric conversion.
- Pattern and inputmode set for all number fields.

## 🪄 UI/UX
- All input fields now provide a more consistent and accessible experience, especially on mobile devices and for international users.
- No visible layout or feature changes, but improved reliability and flexibility for all input.

## 📝 Known Limitations
- Deleting a run or supply does not restore inventory/stock.
- No cloud/multi-user features.
- TXT import expects correct format—edit with care!
- Export still uses `.` as decimal separator for compatibility.
