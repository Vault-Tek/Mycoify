# Mycoify v0.1.03 ‚Äì Patch Notes

## ‚ú® New Features & Improvements

### üóëÔ∏è "Soft Delete" for All Major Records (Supplies, Runs, Tubs, Offloads)
- **Delete now marks items as "deleted" instead of immediately removing them** from the database.
  - Supplies, Production Runs, Colonizing Tubs, Fruiting Tubs, and Offloads all gain a `"deleted"` property.
  - Deleted items are hidden from the UI but retained in storage and in export/import (as `"| DELETED"` in TXT log).
  - This prevents accidental data loss and allows for full history/undo potential in future versions.

- **TXT Export/Import fully supports soft-deleted records**:
  - Any record marked deleted is exported with a `"| DELETED"` flag at the end of its line.
  - Import parses and restores all deleted flags, keeping your full audit trail safe.

### üçÑ Fruiting & Harvest Workflow Refinements
- **Colonizing ‚Üí Fruiting Move:**  
  - Moving a tub to Fruiting now marks the original colonizing tub as deleted (instead of removing).
  - Fruiting tubs also gain `deleted` and `harvested` flags.

- **Harvested Fruiting Tubs Log:**  
  - Deleting (harvesting) a fruiting tub now moves it to a separate `harvestedTubs` log (with species, tubId, fruiting date, harvested date, and deleted status).
  - This enables complete tracking/auditing of all tub lifecycle events.

- **"Log Fruit" Button:**  
  - Each fruiting tub row now includes a "Log Fruit" button to directly add a harvest (in grams) to your mushroom stock, without leaving the Fruiting tab.

### üß© UI/UX & Interaction Improvements
- **Hamburger/side menu** actions work more robustly (hide hamburger when open, close on click, disables double triggers).
- **Tub ID suggestion** for colonizing always updates to show the correct next available value, even after deletion.
- **Deleting a supply or run** now just hides it; it can still be exported/restored.

### üì¶ TXT Export/Import Upgrades
- **Exported logs now include**:
  - `| DELETED` for any deleted record.
  - A `==== HARVESTED TUBS ====` section listing fully harvested tubs.
- **Import logic is robust**:
  - All deleted flags and harvested status are restored.
  - All sections and historic data are preserved.

### üõ†Ô∏è Everything Else (Retained from v0.1.x)
- All inputs accept dot/comma decimals.
- All UI and tab logic as in previous version.
- Local storage, notifications, and summary dashboard all function as before.

## üìù Known Limitations / Notes
- Deleted records are not visible in the app, but remain in exports/imports.
- No "undelete" (restore) feature yet.
- No cloud/multi-user or advanced analytics.
- TXT import expects correct format.

**Upgrade Note:**  
You are now protected from accidental deletions across all your lab data. Exports keep your entire lab history, including deleted and harvested items, for full audit and backup!
