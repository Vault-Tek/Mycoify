# Mycoify v0.0.04 – Patch Notes

## 🚀 Major Feature: Full Tub Flush Logging & Dumping

### 🍄 Fruiting Tab Now Supports Detailed Flush Tracking!
- **Log multiple flushes per tub:**  
  - Each fruiting tub now has a "Log Fruit / Flush" button.
  - Opens a **modal dialog** where you can:
    - Specify flush number (text, no arrows, default 1 or next in sequence)
    - Enter flush date (defaults to today)
    - Enter harvested grams
    - View full flush history for the tub
    - **Log a "dump"** (failed/contaminated tub) with a single click; this records the dump and removes the tub from active tracking.
- **Flushes are recorded per tub** and displayed as a history in the modal.
- **Tub dumping** moves the tub to a "harvested/removed" log with status "Dumped".

### 🗄️ Audit & Soft Delete for All Major Entities
- **Soft delete for:**  
  - Supplies
  - Production runs
  - Colonizing tubs
  - Fruiting tubs
  - Offloads
- Deleted items are hidden from the main UI but preserved in TXT export/import as `| DELETED`.
- Supplies and runs can be "restored" (if re-added with the same name/unit, they reappear).

### 📦 TXT Export/Import Upgrades
- **Export now includes:**  
  - All deleted records (with `| DELETED`)
  - Flush logs:  
    - `tubId | flushNum | date | grams`
    - `tubId | DUMPED | date` for dumped tubs
  - "HARVESTED TUBS" section (harvested or dumped, with status)
- **Import restores:**  
  - All records, deleted status, flush logs, and tub history.

### 🧑‍🔬 Usability & Workflow
- Flush logging, dump, and modal UI for fruiting tab
- Tub ID auto-suggestion works after deletes/dumps
- Soft delete for all entities, with full history in export/import
- Modal can be dismissed by clicking outside or Escape key

### 🖥️ UI/UX
- All flush/dump actions are via modal, not prompt
- All forms remain mobile-friendly
- No accidental data loss due to delete—everything is recoverable in export

## 🛠️ Everything Else (Retained from 0.1.x)
- Decimal/comma input, local storage, notifications, inventory/runs/harvest/offload, colonizing/fruition workflows

## 📝 Known Limitations
- No "undelete" UI (restoration is by re-adding, or via manual file edit/import)
- No cloud sync/multi-user
- TXT import expects correct format
